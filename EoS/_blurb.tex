\textbf{Only the greatest sacrifice can turn the tide of war.}

\hfill \break War is brewing in the fifth book of the \#1 bestselling Throne of Glass series by Sarah J. Maas.

\hfill \break The long path to the throne has only just begun for Aelin Galathynius as war looms on the horizon. Loyalties have been broken and bought, friends have been lost and gained, and those who possess magic find themselves increasingly at odds with those who don't.

\hfill \break With her heart sworn to the warrior-prince by her side and her fealty pledged to the people she is determined to save, Aelin will delve into the depths of her power to protect those she loves. But as monsters emerge from the horrors of the past, dark forces stand poised to claim her world. The only chance for salvation lies in a desperate quest that may take more from Aelin than she has to give, a quest that forces her to choose what-and who-she's willing to sacrifice for the sake of peace.

\hfill \break Kingdoms collide in this fifth book in the \#1 New York Times bestselling Throne of Glass series.
