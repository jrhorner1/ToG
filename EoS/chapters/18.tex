\chapter{18}

Manon saw only the flash of her grandmother's rusted iron teeth, the glimmer of her iron nails as she raised them to ward against the sword---but too late.

Manon slashed Wind-Cleaver down, a blow that would have cut most men in half.

Yet her grandmother darted back fast enough that the sword sliced down her torso, ripping fabric and skin as it cut between her breasts in a shallow line.
Blue blood sprayed, but the Matron was moving, blocking Manon's next blow with her iron nails---iron so hard that Wind-Cleaver bounced off.

Manon did not look to see if the Thirteen obeyed.
But Asterin was roaring; roaring and shouting to \emph{stop}.
The cries grew more distant, then echoed, as if she were now inside the hall, being dragged away.

No sounds of pursuit---as if the onlookers were too stunned.
Good.

Iskra and Petrah had swords out, iron teeth down as they stepped between their Matrons and Manon, herding their two High Witches away.

The Blackbeak Matron's coven lunged forward, only to be halted by a hand.
"Stay back," her grandmother commanded, panting as Manon circled her.
Blue blood leaked down her grandmother's front.
An inch closer, and she'd have been dead.

Dead.

Her grandmother bared her rusted teeth.
"She's mine."
She jerked her chin at Manon.
"We do this the ancient way."

Manon's stomach roiled, but she sheathed her sword.

A flick of her wrists had her nails out, and a snap of her jaw had her teeth descending.

"Let's see how good you are, Wing Leader," her grandmother hissed, and attacked.

Manon had never seen her grandmother fight, never trained with her.

And some small part of Manon wondered if it was because her grandmother did not want others to know how skilled she was.

Manon could hardly move fast enough to avoid the nails ripping into her face, her neck, her gut, yielding step after step after step.

She only had to do this long enough to buy the Thirteen time to get to the skies.

Her grandmother slashed for her cheek, and Manon blocked the blow with an elbow, slamming the joint down hard into her grandmother's forearm.
The witch barked in pain, and Manon spun out of reach, circling again.

"It is not so easy to strike now is it, Manon Blackbeak?"
her grandmother panted as they surveyed each other.
No one around them dared move; the Thirteen had vanished---every last one of them.
She almost sagged with relief.
Now to keep her grandmother occupied long enough to avoid her giving the onlookers the order to pursue.
"So much easier with a blade, the weapon of those cowardly humans," her grandmother seethed.
"With the teeth, the nails\ldots You have to \emph{mean}
it."

They lunged for each other, some fundamental part of her cracking with every slash and swipe and block.
They darted apart again.

"As pathetic as your mother," her grandmother spat.
"Perhaps you'll die like her, too---with my teeth at your throat."

Her mother, whom she'd killed coming out of, who had died birthing her---

"For years, I tried to train her weakness out of you."
Her grandmother spat blue blood onto the stones.
"For the good of the Ironteeth, I made you into a force of nature, a warrior equal to none.
And this is how you repay me---"

Manon didn't let the words unnerve her.
She went for the throat, only to feint and slash.

Her grandmother barked in pain---genuine \emph{pain}---as Manon's claws shredded her shoulder.

Blood showered her hand, flesh clinging to her nails--- Manon staggered back, bile burning her throat.

She saw the blow coming, but still didn't have time to stop it as her grandmother's right hand slashed across her belly.

Leather, cloth, and skin ripped.
Manon screamed.

Blood, hot and blue, rushed out of her before her grandmother had darted back.

Manon shoved a hand against her abdomen, pushing against the shredded skin.
Blood dribbled through her fingers, splattering onto the stones.

High above, a wyvern roared.

Abraxos.

The Blackbeak Matron laughed, flicking Manon's blood off her nails.
"I'm going to dice your wyvern into tiny pieces and feed him to the hounds."

Despite the agony in her belly, Manon's vision honed.
"Not if I kill you first."

Her grandmother chuckled, still circling, assessing.
"You are stripped of your title as Wing Leader.
You are stripped of your title as heir."
Step after step, closer and closer, an adder looping around its prey.
"From this day, you are Manon Witch Killer, Manon Kin Slayer."

The words pelted her like stones.
Manon backed toward the balcony rail, pushing against the wound in her stomach to keep the blood in.
The crowd parted like water around them.
Just a little longer---just another minute or two.

Her grandmother paused, blinking toward the open doors, as if realizing the Thirteen had vanished.
Manon attacked again before she could give the order to pursue.

Swipe, lunge, slash, duck---they moved in a whirlwind of iron and blood and leather.

But as Manon twisted away, the wounds in her stomach gave more, and she stumbled.

Her grandmother didn't miss a beat.
She struck.

Not with her nails or teeth, but with her foot.

The kick to Manon's stomach set her screaming, a roar again answered by Abraxos, locked high above.
Soon to die, as she would.
She prayed the Thirteen would spare him, let him join them wherever they would flee.

Manon slammed into the stone rail of the balcony and crumpled to the black tiles.
Blue blood leaked from her, staining the thighs of her pants.

Her grandmother slowly approached, panting.

Manon grabbed the balcony rail, hauling herself to her feet one last time.

"Do you want to know a secret, Kin Slayer?"
her grandmother breathed.

Manon slumped against the balcony rail, the drop below endless and a relief.
They'd take her to the dungeons---either use her for Erawan's breeding, or torture her until she begged for death.
Maybe both.

Her grandmother spoke so softly that even Manon could barely hear over her own gasps for air.
"As your mother labored to push you out, she confessed who your father was.
She said you\ldots \emph{you} would be the one who broke the curse, who saved us.
She said your father was a rare-born Crochan Prince.
And she said that your mixed blood would be the key."
Her grandmother lifted her nails to her mouth and licked off Manon's blue blood.

No.

\emph{No}.

"So you have been a Kin Slayer your whole life," her grandmother purred.
"Hunting down those Crochans---your \emph{relatives}.
When you were a witchling, your father searched the lands for you.
He never stopped loving your mother.

\emph{Loving} her," she spat.
"And loving you.
So I killed him."
Manon gazed at the drop below, the death that beckoned.

"His despair was delicious when I told him what I'd done to her.
What I would make you into.
Not a child of peace---but war."
\emph{Made.}

\emph{Made.}

\emph{Made.}

Manon's iron nails chipped on the dark stone of the balcony rail.
And then her grandmother said the words that broke her.

"Do you know why that Crochan was spying in the Ferian Gap this spring?
She had been sent to find \emph{you}.
After a hundred and sixteen years of searching,

they had finally learned the identity of their dead prince's lost child."

Her grandmother's smile was hideous in its absolute triumph.
Manon willed strength to her arms, to her legs.

"Her name was Rhiannon, after the last Crochan Queen.
And she was your half sister.
She confessed it to me upon our tables.
She thought it'd save her life.
And when she saw what you had become, she chose to let the knowledge die with her."

"I am a Blackbeak," Manon rasped, blood choking her words.

Her grandmother took a step, smiling as she crooned, "You are a Crochan.
The last of their royal bloodline with the death of your sister at your own hand.

You are a Crochan \emph{Queen}."

Absolute silence from the witches gathered.

Her grandmother reached for her.
"And you're going to die like one by the time I'm finished with you."

Manon didn't let her grandmother's nails touch her.

A boom sounded nearby.

Manon used the strength she'd gathered in her arms, her legs, to hurl herself onto the stone ledge of the balcony.

And roll off it into the open air.

\begin{center}

\end{center}

Air and rock and wind and blood---

Manon slammed into a warm, leathery hide, screaming as pain from her wounds blacked out her vision.

Above, somewhere far away, her grandmother was shrieking orders---

Manon dug her nails into the leathery hide, burying her claws deep.
Beneath her, a bark of discomfort she recognized.
Abraxos.

But she held firm, and he embraced the pain as he banked to the side, swerving out of Morath's shadow--- She felt them around her.

Manon managed to open her eyes, flicking the clear lid against the wind into place.

Edda and Briar, her Shadows, were now flanking her.
She knew they'd been there, waiting in the shadows with their wyverns, had heard every one of those damning last words.
"The others have flown ahead.
We were sent to retrieve you," Edda, the eldest of the sisters, shouted over the roar of the wind.
"Your wound---"

"It's shallow," Manon snapped, forcing the pain aside to focus on the task at hand.
She was on Abraxos's neck, the saddle a few feet behind her.
One by one, every breath an agony, she released her nails from his skin and slid toward the saddle.
He evened out his flight, offering smooth air to buckle herself into the harness.

Blood leaked from the gouges in her belly---soon the saddle was slick with it.

Behind them, several roars set the mountains trembling.

"We can't let them get to the others," Manon managed to say.

Briar, black hair streaming behind her, swept in closer.
"Six Yellowlegs on our tail.
From Iskra's personal coven.
Closing in fast."

With a score to settle, they'd no doubt been given free rein to slaughter them.

Manon surveyed the peaks and ravines of the mountains around them.

"Two apiece," she ordered.
The Shadows' black wyverns were enormous--- skilled at stealth, but devastating in a fight.
"Edda, you drive two to the west;

Briar, you slam the other two to the east.
Leave the last two to me."
No sign of the rest of the Thirteen in the gray clouds or mountains.

Good---they had gotten away.
It was enough.

"You kill them, then you find the others," Manon ordered, an arm draped over her wound.

"But, Wing Leader---"

The title almost sapped her will.
But Manon barked, "\emph{That's an order}."

The Shadows bowed their heads.
Then, as if sharing one mind, one heart, they banked to either direction, peeling away from Manon like petals in the wind.

Bloodhounds on a scent, four Yellowlegs split from their group to deal with each Shadow.

The two in the center flew faster, harder, spreading apart to close in on Manon.
Her vision blurred.

Not a good sign---not a good sign at all.

She breathed to Abraxos, "Let's make it a final stand worthy of song."
He bellowed in answer.

The Yellowlegs swept near enough for Manon to count their weapons.
A battle cry shattered from the one to her right.

Manon dug her left heel into Abraxos's side.

Like a shooting star, he blasted down toward the peaks of the ashy mountains.
The Yellowlegs dove with them.

Manon aimed for a ravine running through the spine of the mountain range, her vision flashing black and white and foggy.
A chill crept into her bones.

The walls of the ravine closed around them like the maw of a mighty beast, and she pulled on the reins once.

Abraxos flung out his wings and coasted along the side of the ravine before catching a current and leveling out, flapping like hell through the heart of the crevasse, pillars of stone jutting from the floor like lances.

The Yellowlegs, too ensnared in their bloodlust, their wyverns too large and bulky, balked at the ravine---at the sharp turn---

A boom and a screech, and the whole ravine shuddered.

Manon swallowed her bark of agony to peer behind.
One of the wyverns had panicked, too big for the space, and slammed into a stone column.
Broken bone and blood rained down.

But the other wyvern had managed to bank, and now sailed toward them, wings so wide they nearly grazed either side of the ravine.
Manon panted through her bloody teeth, "\emph{Fly, Abraxos}."
And her gentle, warrior-hearted mount flew.

Manon focused on keeping to the saddle, on keeping the arm pressed against her wound to hold the blood in, keep that lethal cold away.
She'd gotten enough injuries to know her grandmother had struck deep and true.

The ravine swerved right, and Abraxos took the turn with expert skill.
She prayed for the boom and roar of the pursuing wyvern to hit the walls, but none came.

But Manon knew these deadly canyons.
She'd flown this path countless times on the endless, inane patrols these months.
The Yellowlegs, sequestered in the Ferian Gap, did not.

"To the very end, Abraxos," she said.
His roar was his only confirmation.

One shot.
She'd have one shot.
Then she could gladly die, knowing the Thirteen wouldn't be pursued.
Not today, at least.

Turn after turn, Abraxos hurtled through the ravine, snapping his own tail against the rock to send debris flying into the Yellowlegs sentinel.

The rider dodged the rocks, her wyvern bobbing on the wind.
Closer--- Manon needed her closer.
She tugged on Abraxos's reins, and he checked his speed.

Turn after turn after turn, black rock flashing by, blurring like her own fading vision.

The Yellowlegs was near enough to throw a dagger.

Manon looked over a shoulder with her failing eyesight in time to see her do just that.

Not one dagger---but two, metal gleaming in the dim canyon light.

Manon braced herself for the impact of metal in flesh and bone.

Abraxos took the final turn as the sentinel hurled her daggers at Manon.
A towering, impenetrable wall of black stone arose, mere feet away.

But Abraxos soared up, catching the updraft and sailing out of the heart of the ravine, so close Manon could touch the dead-end wall.

The two daggers struck the rock where Manon had been moments before.

And the Yellowlegs sentinel, on her bulky, heavy wyvern, did as well.

Rock groaned as wyvern and rider splattered against it.
And fell to the ravine floor.

Panting, her breath a wet, bloody rasp, Manon patted Abraxos's side.
Even the motion was feeble.
"Good," she managed to say.

Mountains became small again.
Oakwald spread before her.
Trees---the cover of trees might hide her\ldots "Oak\ldots ," she rasped.

Manon didn't finish the command before the Darkness swept in to claim her.
