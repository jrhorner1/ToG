\chapter{38}

Though Kashin might have been loath to push his father in public or private, he certainly was not without his resources. And as Chaol approached the sealed doors to the khagan's trade meeting, he hid his grin when he discovered Hashim, Shen, and two other guards he'd trained with stationed outside. Shen winked at him, his armor glinting in the watery morning sunlight, and swiftly knocked with his artificial hand before opening the door.

Chaol didn't dare give Shen, Hashim, or the other guards so much as a nod of gratitude or acknowledgment. Not as he wheeled his chair into the sun-drenched council room and found the khagan and three golden-robed viziers around a long table of black polished wood.

They all stared at him in silence. But Chaol kept approaching the table, his head high, face set in a pleasant, subdued smile. "I hope I'm not interrupting, but there is a matter I should like to discuss."

The khagan's lips pressed into a tight line. He wore a light green tunic and dark trousers, cut close enough to reveal the warrior's body still lurking beneath the aged exterior. "I have told you time and again, Lord Westfall, that you should speak to my Chief Vizier"---a nod to the sour-faced man across from him---"if you wish to arrange a meeting."

Chaol halted before the table, flexing and shifting his feet. He'd gone through as much of his leg exercises as he could this morning after his workout with the palace guard, and though he'd regained movement up to his knees, placing weight on them, \emph{standing} 

He cast the thought from his mind. Standing or sitting had nothing to do with it---this moment.

He could still speak with dignity and command whether he stood on his feet or was laid flat on his back. The chair was no prison, nothing that made him lesser.

So Chaol bowed his head, smiling faintly. "With all due respect, Great

Khagan, I am not here to meet with you."

Urus blinked, his only show of surprise as Chaol inclined his head to the man in sky-blue robes whom Kashin had described. "I am here to speak to your foreign trade vizier."

The vizier glanced between his khagan and Chaol, as if ready to proclaim his innocence, even as interest gleamed in his brown eyes. But he did not dare speak.

Chaol held the khagan's stare for long seconds.

He didn't remind himself that he had interrupted a private meeting of perhaps the most powerful man in the world. Didn't remind himself that he was a guest in a foreign court and the fate of his friends and countrymen depended on what he accomplished here. He just stared at the khagan, man to man, warrior to warrior.

He had fought a king before and lived to tell.

The khagan at last jerked his chin to an empty spot at the table. Not a ringing welcome, but better than nothing.

Chaol nodded his thanks and approached, keeping his breathing even while he looked all four men in the eye and said to the vizier of foreign trade, "I received word that two large orders of firelances have been placed by Captain Rolfe's armada, one prior to Aelin Galathynius's arrival in Skull's Bay, and an even larger one afterward."

The khagan's white brows flicked up. The foreign trade vizier shifted in his seat, but nodded. "Yes," he said in Chaol's tongue. "That is true."

"How much, exactly, would you say each firelance costs?"

The viziers glanced among one another, and it was another man, whom Chaol presumed to be the domestic trade vizier, that named the sum.

Chaol only waited. Kashin had told him the astronomical number last night. And, just as he'd gambled, the khagan whipped his head to the vizier at that cost.

Chaol asked, "And how many are now being sent to Rolfe---and thus to Terrasen?"

Another number. Chaol let the khagan do the math. Watched from the corner of his eye as the khagan's brows rose even higher.

The Chief Vizier braced his forearms on the table. "Are you trying to convince us of Aelin Galathynius's good or ill intentions, Lord Westfall?"

Chaol ignored the barb. He simply said to the foreign trade vizier, "I would like to place another order. I would like to double the Queen of Terrasen's order, actually."

Silence.

The foreign trade vizier looked like he'd flip over in his chair.

But the Chief Vizier sneered, "With what money?"

Chaol turned a lazy grin on the man. "I came here with four trunks of priceless treasure." A kingdom's ransom, as it were. "I think it should cover the cost."

Utter quiet once more.

Until the khagan asked his foreign trade vizier, "And will it cover the cost?"

"The treasure would have to be assessed and weighed---"

"It is already being done," Chaol said, leaning back in his chair. "You shall have the number by this afternoon."

Another beat of silence. Then the khagan murmured in Halha to the foreign trade vizier, who gathered up his papers and scurried out of the room with a wary glance at Chaol. A flat word from the khagan to his Chief Vizier and the domestic trade vizier, and both men also left, the former throwing another cold sneer Chaol's way before departing.

Alone with the khagan, Chaol waited in silence.

Urus rose from his chair, stalking to the wall of windows that overlooked a blooming, shaded garden. "I suppose you think you are very clever, to use this to get an audience with me."

"I spoke true," Chaol said. "I wished to discuss the deal with your foreign trade vizier. Even if your armies will not join us, I don't see how anyone can object to our purchase of your weapons."

"And no doubt, this was meant to make me realize how lucrative this war might be, if your side is willing to invest in our resources." Chaol remained silent.

The khagan turned from the garden view, the sunlight making his white hair glow. "I do not appreciate being manipulated into this war, Lord Westfall." Chaol held the man's stare, even as he gripped the arms of his chair.

The khagan asked quietly, "Do you even know what warfare \emph{is}?"

Chaol clenched his jaw. "I suppose I'm about to find out, aren't I."

The khagan didn't so much as smile. "It is not mere battles and supplies and strategy. Warfare is the absolute dedication of one army against their enemies." A long, weighing look. "That is what you stand against---Morath's rallied, solid front. Their conviction in decimating you into dust."

"I know that well."

"Do you? Do you understand what Morath is doing to you already? They build and plan and strike, and you can barely keep up. You are playing by the rules Perrington sets---and you will lose because of it."

His breakfast turned over in his stomach. "We might still triumph."

The khagan shook his head once. "To do that, your triumph must be complete. Every last bit of resistance squashed."

His legs itched---and he shifted his feet just barely. \emph{Stand}, he willed them.

\emph{Stand}.

He pushed his feet down, muscles barking in protest.

"Which is why," Chaol snarled as his legs refused to obey, "we need your armies to aid us."

The khagan glanced toward Chaol's straining feet, as if he could see the struggle waging in his body. "I do not appreciate being hunted like some prize stag in a wood. I told you to wait; I told you to grant me the respect of grieving for my daughter---"

"And what if I told you that your daughter might have been murdered?" Silence, horrible and hollow, filled the space between them.

Chaol snapped, "What if I told you that agents of Perrington might be here, and might already be hunting \emph{you}, manipulating \emph{you}
into or out of this?"

The khagan's face tightened. Chaol braced himself for the roaring, for Urus to perhaps draw the long, jeweled knife at his side and slam it into his chest. But the khagan only said quietly, "You are dismissed."

As if the guards had listened to every word, the doors cracked open, a grimfaced Hashim beckoning Chaol toward the wall.

Chaol didn't move. Footsteps approached from behind. To physically remove him.

He slammed his feet into the pedals of his chair, pushing and straining, gritting his teeth. Like hell they'd haul him out of here; like hell he'd let them drag him away---

"I came to not only save my people, but \emph{all} peoples of this world," Chaol growled at the khagan.

Someone---Shen---gripped the handles of his chair and began to turn him.

Chaol twisted, teeth bared at the guard. "\emph{Don't touch it.}"

But Shen didn't release the handles, even as apology shone in his eyes. He knew---Chaol realized the guard knew just how it felt to have the chair touched, moved, without being asked. Just as Chaol knew what defying the khagan's order to escort him from the room might mean for Shen.

So Chaol again fixed his stare on the khagan. "Your city is the greatest I have ever laid eyes upon, your empire the standard by which all others should be measured. When Morath comes to lay waste to it, who will stand with you if we are all carrion?"

The khagan's eyes burned like coals.

Shen kept pushing his chair toward that door.

Chaol's arms shook with the effort to keep from shoving the guard away, his legs trembling as he tried and tried to rise. Chaol looked over his shoulder and growled, "I stood on the wrong side of the line for too damn long, and it cost me \emph{everything}. Do not make the same mistakes that I---"

"Do not presume to tell a khagan what he must do," Urus said, his eyes like chips of ice. He jerked his chin to the guards shifting on their feet at the door. "Escort Lord Westfall back to his rooms. Do not allow him into my meetings again."

The threat lay beneath the calm, cold words. Urus had no need to raise his voice, to roar to make his promise of punishment clear enough to the guards.

Chaol pushed and pushed against his chair, arms straining as he fought to stand, to even rise slightly.

But then Shen had his chair through the doors, and down the gleaming bright hallways.

Still his body did not obey. Did not answer.

The doors to the khagan's council chamber shut with a soft click that reverberated through Chaol's every bone and muscle, the sound more damning than any word the khagan had uttered.

\includegraphics[width=1.12in,height=0.24in]{images/seperator}

Yrene had left Chaol to his thoughts the night before.

Left them as she stormed back to the Torre and decided that Hasar
 Oh, she

did not mind manipulating the princess one bit. And realized precisely how she'd get the princess to invite her to that damned oasis.

But it seemed that even a morning in the training ring with the guards had not soothed the jagged edge in Chaol's own temper. The temper still simmering as he waited in the sitting room while Yrene sent Kadja off on another fool's errand ---\emph{twine, goat's milk, and vinegar}---and at last readied to work on him.

Summer was boiling toward a steamy close, the wild winds of autumn beginning to lash at the waters of the turquoise bay. It was always warm in Antica, but the Narrow Sea turned rough and unwieldy from Yulemas to Beltane. If an armada did not sail from the southern continent before then  Well, Yrene supposed that after last night, one wouldn't sail anyway.

Sitting near their usual gold couch, Chaol didn't greet her with more than a cursory glance. Not at all like his usual grim smile. And the shadows under his eyes  Any thought of rushing in here to tell him of her plan flowed out of

Yrene's head as she asked, "Were you up all night?" "For parts of it," he said, his voice low.

Yrene approached the couch but did not sit. Instead, she simply watched him, folding her arms across her abdomen. "Perhaps the khagan will consider. He's aware of how his children scheme. He's too smart not to have seen Arghun and

Hasar working in tandem---for once---and to not be suspicious."

"And you know the khagan so well?" A cold, biting question.

"No, but I've certainly lived here a good deal longer than you have."

His brown eyes flashed. "I don't have two years to spare. To play their games."

And she did, apparently.

Yrene stifled her irritation. "Well, brooding about it won't fix anything."

His nostrils flared. "Indeed."

She hadn't seen him like this in weeks.

Had it been so long already? Her birthday was in a fortnight. Sooner than she'd realized.

It wasn't the time to mention it, or the plan she'd hatched. It was inconsequential, really, given everything swarming around them. The burdens he bore. The frustration and despair she now saw pushing on those shoulders.

"Tell me what happened." Something had---something had shifted since they'd parted ways last night.

A cutting glance her way. She braced herself for his refusal as his jaw tightened.

But then he said, "I went to see the khagan this morning."

"You got an audience?"

"Not quite." His lips thinned.

"What happened?" Yrene braced a hand on the arm of the sofa.

"He had me hauled out of the room." Cold, flat words. "I couldn't even try to get around the guards. Try to make him listen."

"If you'd been standing, they'd have hauled you away all the same." Likely hurt him in the process.

He glared. "I didn't want to fight them. I wanted to \emph{beg} him. And I couldn't even get onto my knees to do it."

Her heart strained as he looked toward the garden window. Rage and sorrow and fear all crossed over his face. "You've made remarkable progress already."

"I want to be able to fight alongside my men again," Chaol said quietly. "To die beside them."

The words were an icy slice of fear through her, but Yrene said stiffly, "You can do that from a horse."

"I want to do it shoulder-to-shoulder," he snarled. "I want to fight in the mud, on a killing field."

"So you'd heal here only so you can go die somewhere else?" The words snapped from her.

"Yes."

A cold, hard answer. His face equally so.

This storm brewing in him  She wouldn't see their progress ruined by it.

And war was truly breaking across their home. Regardless of what he wished to do with himself, he did not---\emph{they} did not have time. Her people in Fenharrow did not have time.

So Yrene stepped up to him, gripped him under a shoulder, and said, "Then get up."

\includegraphics[width=1.12in,height=0.24in]{images/seperator}

Chaol was in a shit mood, and he knew it.

The more he'd thought about it, the more he realized how easily the prince and princess had played him, toyed with him last night 
It didn't matter \emph{what} move Aelin had made. Anything she had done, they would have turned against her. Against him. Had Aelin played the damsel, they would have called her a weak and uncertain ally. There was no way to win.

The meeting with the khagan had been folly. Perhaps Kashin had played him, too. For if the khagan had been willing to hear him out before, he certainly was not going to now. And even if Nesryn returned with Sartaq's rukhin in tow  Her note yesterday had been carefully worded.

\emph{The rukhin are deft archers. They find my own skills intriguing, too. I should like to keep instructing. And learning. They fly free here.} \emph{I'll see you in three weeks.}

He didn't know what to make of it. The penultimate line. Was it an insult to him, or a coded message that the rukhin and Sartaq might disobey the commands of their khagan if he refused to let them leave? Would Sartaq truly risk treason to aid them? Chaol didn't dare leave the message unburned.

\emph{Fly free.} He had never known such a feeling. It would never be his to discover. These weeks with Yrene, dining in the city under the stars, talking to her about everything and nothing  It had come close, perhaps. But it did not change what lay ahead.

No---they were still very much alone in this war. And the longer he lingered, with his friends now in combat, now on the move 

He was still here. In this chair. With no army, no allies.

"Get up."

He slowly faced Yrene as she repeated her command, a hand tightly gripped under his shoulder, her face full of fiery challenge.

Chaol blinked at her. "What." Not quite a question.

"Get. Up." Her mouth tightened. "You want to die in this war so badly, then \emph{get up}."

She was in a mood, too. Good. He'd been aching for a fight---the clashes with the guards still unsatisfactory in this gods-damned chair. But Yrene 

He hadn't allowed himself to touch her these weeks. Had made himself keep a distance, despite her unintentional moments of contact, the times when her head dipped close to his and all he could do was watch her mouth.

Yet he'd seen the tension in her at dinner last night, when Hasar had taunted about Nesryn's return. The disappointment she'd tried so hard to keep hidden, then the relief when he'd revealed Nesryn's extended trip.

He was a champion bastard. Even if he'd managed to convince the khagan to save their asses in this war  He would leave here. Empty handed or with an army, he'd leave. And despite Yrene's plans to return to their continent, he wasn't certain when he'd see her again. If ever.

None of them might make it anyway.

And this one task, this one task that his friends had given him, that Dorian had given him  He'd failed.

Even with all he'd endured, all he'd learned  It was not enough.

Chaol gave a pointed look to his legs. \emph{"How?"} They'd made more progress than he could have dreamed, yet this---

Her grip tightened to the point of pain. "You said it yourself: you don't have two years. I've repaired enough now that you \emph{should} be able to stand. So get up." She even went so far as to tug on him.

He stared at her beneath lowered brows, letting his temper slip its leash by a few notches. "Let go."

"Or \emph{what}?" Oh, she was pissed.

"Who knows what the spies will feed to the royals?" Cold, hard words.

Yrene's mouth tightened. "I have nothing to fear from their reports."

"Don't you? You didn't seem to mind the privileges that came when you snapped your fingers and Kashin ran here. Perhaps he'll grow tired of you stringing him along."

"That is nonsense and you know it." She tugged on his arm. "Get up."

He did no such thing. "So a prince is not good enough for you, but the disowned son of a lord is?"

He'd never even voiced the thought. Even to himself.

"Just because you're pissed off that Hasar and Arghun outmaneuvered you, that the khagan still won't listen to you, doesn't give you the right to try to drag \emph{me} into a fight." Her lips curled back from her teeth. "Now get up, since you're so eager to rush off into battle."

He yanked his shoulder out of her grip. "You didn't answer the question."

"I'm not going to answer the question." Yrene didn't grab his shoulder again, but slid her entire arm under him and grunted, as if she'd lift him herself, when he was nearly double her weight.

Chaol gritted his teeth, and just to avoid her injuring herself, he shook her off again and set his feet on the floor. Braced his hands on the arms of the chair and hauled himself forward as far as he could manage. "And?"

He could move his knees and below, and his thighs had been tingling this past week every now and then, yet 

"And you remember how to stand, don't you?"

He only shot back, "Why did you look so relieved when I said Nesryn would be delayed a few more weeks?"

Color bloomed on her freckled skin, but she reached for him again, looping her arms through his. "I didn't want it to distract you from our progress."

"Liar." Her scent wrapped around him as she tugged, the chair groaning as he began to push down on the arms.

And then Yrene parried and went on the offensive, sleek as a snake. "I think \emph{you} were relieved," she seethed, her breath hot against his ear. "I think \emph{you} were glad for her to remain away, so you can pretend that you are honor-bound to her and let that be a wall. So that when you are here, with me, you don't need to see her watching, don't need to \emph{think} about what she is to you. With her away, she is a memory, a distant ideal, but when she is here, and you look at her, what do you \emph{see}? What do you \emph{feel} ?"

"I had her in my bed, so I think that says enough about my feelings."

He hated the words, even as the temper, the sharpness  it was a relief, too.

Yrene sucked in a breath, but didn't back down. "Yes, you had her in your bed, but I think she was likely a distraction, and was sick of it. Perhaps sick of being a consolation prize."

His arms strained, the chair wobbling as he pushed and pushed upward, if only so he could stand long enough to glare into her face. "You don't know what you're talking about." She had not mentioned Aelin at all, hadn't asked after last night's dinner. Until---

"Did she pick Dorian, then? The queen. I'm surprised she could stomach either of you, given your history. What your kingdom did to hers."

Roaring filled his ears as he began shifting his weight onto his feet, willing his spine to hold while he spat at her, "You didn't seem to mind it one bit, that night at the party. I had you practically begging me." He didn't know what the hell was coming out of his mouth.

Her nails dug into his back. "You'd be surprised the people that opiate makes you consider. Who you'll find yourself willing to sully yourself with."

"Right. A son of Adarlan. An oath-breaking, faithless traitor. That's what I am, isn't it?"

"I wouldn't know---you rarely even attempt to talk about it."

"And you are so good at it, I suppose?"

"This is about you, not me."

"Yet you were assigned to me because your Healer on High saw otherwise. Saw that no matter how high you climbed in that tower, you're still that girl in Fenharrow." A laugh came out of him, icy and bitter. "I knew another woman who lost as much as you. And do you know what she did with it---that loss?" He could barely stop the words from pouring out, could barely think over the roar in his head. "She hunted down the people responsible for it and \emph{obliterated} them.

What the hell have \emph{you} bothered to do these years?" Chaol felt the words hit their mark.

Felt the stillness shudder through her body.

Right as he pushed up---right as his weight adjusted and knees bent, and he found himself standing.

Too far. He'd gone too far. He'd never once believed those things. Even thought them.

Not about Yrene.

Her chest rose in a jagged breath that brushed against his, and she blinked up at him, mouth closing. And with the movement, he could see a wall rising up.

Sealing.

Never again. She'd never again forgive him, smile at him, for what he'd said.

Never forget it. Standing or no.

"Yrene," he rasped, but she slid her arms from him and backed away a step, shaking her head. Leaving him standing---alone. Alone and exposed as she retreated another step and the sunlight caught in the silver starting to line her eyes.

It ripped his chest wide open.

Chaol put a hand on it, as if he could feel the caving within, even as his legs wavered beneath him. "I am \emph{no one} to even mention such things. I am \emph{nothing}, and it was \emph{myself} that I---"

"I might not have battled kings and shattered castles," she said coldly, voice shaking with anger as she continued her retreat, "but I am the heir apparent to the Healer on High. Through my own work and suffering and sacrifice. And you're standing right now because of that. People are \emph{alive} because of that. So I may not be a warrior waving a sword about, may not be worthy of your glorious tales, but at least I \emph{save} lives---not end them."

"I know," he said, fighting the urge to grip the arms of the chair now seeming so far below him as his balance wavered. "Yrene, \emph{I know}." Too far. He had gone too far, and he had never hated himself more, for wanting to pick a fight and being so gods-damned
\emph{stupid}, when he'd really been talking about himself--- Yrene backed away another step.

"Please," he said.

But she was heading for the door. And if she left 

He had let them all go. Had walked out himself, too, but with Aelin, with Dorian, with Nesryn, he had let them go, and he had not gone after them.

But that woman backing toward the door, trying to keep the tears from falling

---tears from the hurt \emph{he'd} caused her, tears of the anger he so rightfully deserved

---

She reached the handle. Fumbled blindly for it.

And if she left, if he let her walk out  Yrene pushed down on the handle.

And Chaol took a step toward her.
