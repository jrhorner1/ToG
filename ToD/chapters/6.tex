\chapter{6}

She'd known his age, but Yrene had still not expected the former captain to look so\ldots young.

She hadn't done the math until she'd walked into that room and seen his handsome face, a mix of caution and hope written across the hardened, broad features.

It was that hope that had made her see red.
Had made her ache to give him a matching scar to the slender one slicing across his cheek.

She'd been unprofessional in the most horrific sense.
Never---\emph{never} had she been so rude and unkind toward any of her patients.

Mercifully, Hasar had arrived, cooling her head slightly.
But touching the man, thinking of ways to \emph{help} him\ldots She had not meant to write the list of the last four generations of Towers women.
Had not meant to write her mother's name over and over while pretending to record his information.
It had not helped with the overwhelming roaring in her head.

Sweating and dusty, Yrene burst into Hafiza's office nearly an hour later, the trek from the palace through the clogged, narrow streets, then the endless steps up here, taking an eternity.

She'd been late---that had been her first truly unprofessional moment.
She'd never been late to an appointment.
Yet right at ten, she'd found herself in an alcove of the hallway outside his bedroom, hands over her face, struggling to breathe.

He hadn't been the brute she'd expected.

He'd spoken well, more lord than soldier.
Though his body had most certainly belonged to the latter.
She had patched up and healed enough of the khagan's favored warriors to know the feel of muscle beneath her fingers.
The scars covering Lord Westfall's tan skin spoke volumes about how the muscles had been earned the hard way.
And now aided him in maneuvering through the world with the chair.

And the injury to his spine\ldots As Yrene halted at the threshold of the Healer on High's office, Hafiza looked up from where she sat beside a sniffling acolyte.

"I need a word," Yrene said tightly, one hand gripping the doorjamb.

"You shall have one when we are done," Hafiza simply replied, handing a handkerchief to the weepy girl.

Some male healers existed, but the majority of those who received Silba's gift were female.
And this girl, likely no more than fourteen\ldots Yrene had been laboring on her cousin's farm at that age.
\emph{Dreaming} of being here.
Certainly not crying to anyone about her sorry lot in life.

But Yrene walked out, shutting the door behind her, and waited against the wall on the narrow landing.

There were two other doors up here: one locked that led into Hafiza's personal workshop, and a door that led into the Healer on High's bedroom; the former carved with an owl taking flight, the latter with an owl at rest.
Silba's symbol.
It was everywhere in the tower---owls carved and embossed in the stone and wood, sometimes in unexpected places and with silly little expressions, as if some long-ago acolyte had etched them as a secret joke.
But the owl on the Healer on High's private workshop\ldots Even though it perched atop a gnarled branch of iron that flowed across the door itself, wings flared wide as it prepared to leap into the skies, it seemed\ldots alert.
Aware of all who passed that door, who perhaps gazed too long in the direction of the workshop.
None but Hafiza possessed the key to it, handed down by her predecessor.
Ancient, half-forgotten knowledge and devices lay within, the acolytes whispered---unnatural things that were better locked up than set loose in the world.

Yrene always laughed at their hushed words, but didn't tell them she and a few select others had been granted the pleasure of joining Hafiza in that workshop, which, save for the sheer \emph{age} of some of the tools and furniture, held nothing worth gossiping about.
But the mystery of the Healer on High's workshop persisted, as it had likely done for centuries---yet another well-loved myth of the Torre, passed on from acolyte to acolyte.

Yrene fanned her face, still out of breath from the climb and the heat.
She leaned her head back against the cool stone, and again felt for the scrap of paper in her pocket.
She wondered if the lord had noticed how often she'd grabbed that stranger's note.
If he'd thought she was reaching for a weapon.
He'd seen everything, been aware of her every breath.

A man trained for it.
He had to be, if he'd served the dead king.
Just as Nesryn Faliq, a child of this continent, now served the king of a territory that had not treated outsiders very well at all.

Yrene could not make sense of it.
There was some romantic bond, she knew from both the tension and comfort between them.
But to what degree\ldots It didn't matter.
Save for the emotional healing the lord would need as well.
A man not used to voicing his feelings, his fears and hopes and hurts---that much was obvious.

The door to Hafiza's office opened at last, and the acolyte emerged, smiling apologetically at Yrene, red-nosed and glassy-eyed.

Yrene sighed through her nose and offered a smile back.
She was not the person who had just barged into the office.
No, even busy as she was, Yrene had always taken time for the acolytes, the homesick ones especially.

No one had sat beside her in the mess hall below during those initial days.

Yrene still remembered those lonely meals.
Remembered that she'd broken after two days and began taking her food to the vast healers' library belowground, hiding from the stiff-backed librarians who forbade such things, with only the occasional mercurial Baast Cat and carved owl for company.

Yrene had returned to the mess hall once her lessons had garnered enough acquaintances to make the prospect of finding a place to sit less daunting, spotting familiar and smiling faces giving her enough courage to leave the library and its enigmatic cats behind for anything but research.

Yrene touched the acolyte on the shoulder and whispered, "Cook made almond cookies this morning.
I smelled them on the way out.
Tell her I want six, but take four of those for yourself."
She winked at the girl.
"Leave the other two for me at my room."

The girl beamed, nodding.
Cook was perhaps Yrene's first friend in the Torre.

She'd spied Yrene eating alone and began sneaking extra treats onto her tray.
Leaving them in her room.
Even in her favorite secret spot in the library.
Yrene had repaid Cook last year by saving her granddaughter from an insidious lung sickness that had crept up on her.
Cook still got weepy whenever they ran into each other, and Yrene had made it a point to stop by the girl's house once a month to check on her.

When she left, she'd have to ask someone to look after the girl.
Cleaving herself from this life she'd built\ldots It would be no easy task.
And come with no small amount of guilt.

Yrene watched the still-sniffling acolyte hop down the wide spiral stairs, then took a deep breath and strode into Hafiza's office.

"Will the young lord walk again?"
Hafiza asked by way of greeting, white brows high on her forehead.

Yrene slid into her usual chair, the seat still warm from the girl who'd just vacated it.

"He will.
The injury is nearly twin to the one I healed last winter.
But it will be tricky."

"In regard to the healing, or you?"

Yrene blushed.
"I behaved\ldots poorly."

"That was to be expected."

Yrene wiped the sweat from her brow.
"I'm embarrassed to tell you how badly."

"Then don't.
Do better the next time, and we'll consider this another lesson."

Yrene sagged in her chair, stretching her aching legs on the worn carpet.
No matter how Hafiza's servants begged, she refused to change the red-and-green rug.
It had been good enough for the last five of her predecessors, and it was good enough for her.

Yrene leaned her head against the soft back of the chair, staring at the cloudless day beyond the open windows.
"I think I can heal him," she said, more to herself than Hafiza.
"If he cooperates, I could get him walking again."

"And will he cooperate?"

"I was not the only one who behaved poorly," she said.
"Though he's from Adarlan---it could be his nature."

Hafiza huffed a laugh.
"When do you return to him?"
Yrene hesitated.

"You \emph{will} return, won't you?"
Hafiza pushed.

Yrene picked at the sun-blanched threads of the chair's arm.
"It was hard--- hard to look at him, hear his accent, and \ldots" She stilled her hand.
"But you are right.
I shall\ldots try.
If only so Adarlan may never hold it against me."

"Do you expect them to?"

"He has powerful friends who might remember.
His companion is the \emph{new} Captain of the Guard.
Her family hails from here, yet she serves them."

"And what does that tell you?"

Always a lesson, always a test.
"It tells me\ldots" Yrene blew out a breath.
"It tells me I don't know as much as I assumed."
She straightened.
"But it also doesn't forgive them of any sins."

Yet she had met plenty of bad people in her life.
Lived among them, served them, in Innish.
She had taken one look at Lord Westfall's brown eyes and had known, deep down, he was not one of them.
Neither was his companion.

And with his age\ldots He had been a boy when so many of those atrocities had been committed.
He still could have played some part, and plenty more had been done in recent years---enough to make her ill at the thought---but\ldots "The injury to his spine," Yrene said.
"He claims some foul magic did it."
Her magic had recoiled against the splattered mark.
Curved away.

"Oh?"

She shivered.
"I've never\ldots I've never felt \emph{anything} like that.
As if it was rotted, yet empty.
Cold as the longest winter night."

"I shall have to take your word on that one."

Yrene snorted, grateful for the dry humor.
Indeed, Hafiza had never so much as seen snow.
With Antica's year-round warm climate, the closest they'd gotten to winter these two years was perhaps a crust of frost sparkling over the lavender and lemon trees one morning.

"It was\ldots" Yrene brushed off the memory of the echo still held within that scar.
"It was not any magic-wound I had encountered before."

"Will it impact the healing of his spine?"

"I don't know.
I haven't tried to probe with my power yet, but\ldots I'll let you know."

"I'm at your disposal."

"Even if this is my final test?"

"A good healer," Hafiza said with a smile, "knows when to ask for help."

Yrene nodded absently.
And when she sailed back home, to war and bloodshed, who would she turn to then?

"I'll go back," Yrene said at last.
"Tomorrow.
I want to look into spinal injuries and paralysis in the library tonight."

"I'll let Cook know where to find you."

Yrene gave Hafiza a wry grin.
"Nothing escapes you, does it?"
Hafiza's knowing look wasn't comforting.

The healer didn't return that day.
Nesryn waited for another hour, then two, Chaol filling his time with reading in the sitting room, before she finally declared she was going to see her family.

It had been years since she'd seen her aunt and uncle and their children.
She prayed they were still in the house where she'd last visited.

She'd barely slept.
Had barely been able to think or feel things like hunger or exhaustion thanks to the thoughts wreaking havoc within her.

The healer with her lack of answers hadn't soothed her.

And with no formal meeting scheduled with the khagan or his children today\ldots "I can entertain myself, you know," Chaol said, setting his book on his lap as Nesryn again looked to the foyer door.
"I'd join you, if I could."

"You soon will be able to," she promised.
The healer had seemed skilled enough, despite her refusal to even give them a shred of hope.

If the woman couldn't help them, then Nesryn would find another.
And another.
Even if she had to beg the Healer on High to help.

"Go, Nesryn," Chaol ordered.
"You'll get no peace until you do."

She rubbed her neck, then rose from her spot on the golden couch and strode over to him.
Braced her hands on either arm of his chair, currently positioned by the open garden doors.
She brought her face close to his, closer than it'd been in days.
His own eyes seemed\ldots brighter, somehow.
A smidge better than yesterday.
"I'll come back as soon as I can."

He gave her a quiet smile.
"Take your time.
See your family."
He had not seen his mother or brother in years, he'd told her.
His father\ldots Chaol did not talk about his father.

"Perhaps," she said quietly, "we could get an answer for the healer."
He blinked at her.

She murmured, "About the completion."

That fast, the light winked out from his eyes.

She withdrew quickly.
He'd stopped her on the boat, when she'd practically leaped atop him.
And seeing him without his shirt earlier, those muscles rippling along his back, his stomach\ldots She'd almost begged the healer to let \emph{her} do the inspecting.

Pathetic.
Though she'd never been particularly good at avoiding her \emph{cravings}.
She'd started sleeping with him that summer because she didn't see the point in resisting where her interest tugged her.
Even if she hadn't cared for him, not as she did now.

Nesryn slid a hand through her hair.
"I'll be back by dinner."

Chaol waved her off, and was already reading his book again when she left the room.

They had made no promises, she reminded herself.
She knew his tendencies drove him to want to do right by her, to honor her, and this summer, when that castle had collapsed and she'd thought him dead\ldots She had never known such fear.
She had never prayed as she had in those moments---until Aelin's flame spared her from death, and Nesryn had prayed that she had spared him, too.

Nesryn shut out the thoughts of those days as she strode through the palace halls, vaguely remembering where to find the gates to the city proper.
What she'd thought she wanted, what was most important---or had been.
Until the khagan had uttered the news.

She had left her family.
She should have been there.
To protect the children, protect her aging father, her fierce and laughing sister.

"Captain Faliq."

Nesryn halted at the pleasant voice, at the title she was still barely accustomed to answering.
She was standing at one of the palace crossroads, the path ahead to take her to the front gates if she kept going straight.
She had marked every exit they'd passed on the way in.

And at the end of the hallway that bisected hers was Sartaq.

Gone were the fine clothes of yesterday.
The prince now wore close-fitting leathers, the shoulders capped with simple yet sturdy armor, reinforced at the wrists, knees, and shins.
No breastplate.
His long black hair had been braided back, a thin strap of leather tying it off.

She bowed deeply.
Lower than she would have for the other children of the khagan.
But for a rumored Heir apparent, who might one day be Adarlan's ally---

If they survived.

"You were in a hurry," Sartaq said, noting the hall she'd been striding down.

"I---I have family in the city.
I was going to see them."
She added halfheartedly, "Unless Your Highness has need of me."

A wry smile graced his face.
And she realized she'd replied in her own tongue.
\emph{Their} tongue.
"I'm headed for a ride on Kadara.
My ruk," he clarified, falling into his language as well.

"I know," she said.
"I've heard the stories."

"Even in Adarlan?"
He lifted a brow.
A warrior and a charmer.
A dangerous combination, though she could not recall any mention of a spouse.
Indeed, no ring marked his finger.

"Even in Adarlan," Nesryn said, though she did not mention that the average person on the street might not know such tales.
But in her household\ldots Oh, yes.

The Winged Prince, they called him.

"May I escort you?
The streets are a maze, even to me."

It was a generous offer, an honor.
"I would not keep you from the skies."
If only because she did not know how to talk to such men---born and bred to power, used to fine ladies and scheming politicians.
Though his ruk riders, legend claimed, could come from anywhere.

"Kadara is accustomed to waiting," Sartaq said.
"At least let me lead you to the gates.
There is a new guard out today, and I will tell them to mark your face so you may be let back in."

Because with her clothes, her unadorned hair\ldots Indeed, the guards might not permit her past.
Which would have been\ldots mortifying.
"Thank you," she said, and fell into step beside him.

They were silent as they passed white banners streaming from one of the open windows.
Chaol had told her yesterday of Kashin's worry that their youngest sister's death had been through foul play---that one of Perrington's agents might be responsible.
It was enough to plant a seed of dread in her.
To make her mark each face she encountered, peer into every shadow.

Keeping a smooth pace beside him, Nesryn glanced at Sartaq as those banners flitted by.
The prince, however, nodded to a few bowing men and women in the gold robes of viziers.

Nesryn found herself asking, "Are there truly thirty-six of them?"

"We have a fascination with the number, so yes."
He snorted, the sound most un-princely.
"My father debated halving them, but feared the gods' wrath more than political repercussions."

It felt like a breath of crisp autumn air, to hear and speak her own tongue.
To have it be the norm and not be gawked at.
She'd always felt so when coming here.

"Did Lord Westfall meet with the healer?"

There was no harm in the truth, she decided, so Nesryn said, "Yes.
Yrene Towers."

"Ah.
The famed Golden Lady."

"Oh?"

"She is striking, no?"

Nesryn smiled slightly.
"You favor her, I see."

Sartaq chuckled.
"Oh, I wouldn't dare.
My brother Kashin would not be pleased."

"They have an attachment?"
Hasar had hinted at as much.

"They are friends---or were.
I haven't seen them talk in months, but who knows what happened?
Though I suppose I'm no better than the court gossips for telling you."

"It's still useful to know, if we are working with her."

"Was her assessment of Lord Westfall a positive one?"

Nesryn shrugged.
"She was hesitant to confirm."

"Many healers will do that.
They don't like to give hope and take it away."
He flicked his braid over a shoulder.
"Though I will also tell you that Yrene herself healed one of Kashin's Darghan riders last winter of a very similar injury.
And the healers have long repaired such wounds amongst our people's horsetribes and my own rukhin.
They will know what to do."

Nesryn swallowed the hope that blossomed as brightness flared ahead---the open doors to the main courtyard and palace gates.
"How long have you been a ruk rider, Prince?"

"I thought you'd heard the stories."
Humor danced in his face.

"Only gossip.
I prefer the truth."

Sartaq's dark eyes settled on her, their unwavering focus enough to make her glad not to be on the receiving end of it too often.
Not for fear, but\ldots it was unsettling, to have the weight of that gaze wholly upon you.
It was an eagle's gaze---a ruk's gaze.
Keen and piercing.

"I was twelve when my father brought us all to the mountain aerie.
And when I snuck away and climbed onto the captain's own ruk, soaring into the skies and requiring them to chase me down\ldots My father told me that if I had splattered on the rocks, I would have deserved to die for my stupidity.
As punishment, he ordered me to live amongst the rukhin until I could prove I wasn't a complete fool---a lifetime, he suggested."

Nesryn quietly laughed, and blinked against the sunshine as they emerged into the grand courtyard.
Ornate arches and pillars had been carved with flora and fauna, the palace rising up behind them like a leviathan.

"Thankfully, I did not die of stupidity, and instead came to love the riding, their lifestyle.
They gave me hell because I was a prince, but I proved my mettle soon enough.
Kadara hatched when I was fifteen, and I raised her myself.
I have had no other mount since."
Pride and affection brightened those onyx eyes.

And yet Nesryn and Chaol would ask him, beg him, to take that beloved mount into battle against wyverns many times the weight and with infinitely more brute strength.
With venom in their tails.
Her stomach roiled.

They reached the towering main gates, a small door cut into the enormous slabs of studded bronze, left open to allow access to pedestrians scurrying on errands to and from the palace.
Nesryn remained still while Sartaq introduced her to the heavily armed guards on duty, ordering them to grant her unrestricted access.
The sun glinted on the hilts of the swords crossed over their backs as the guards bowed their acquiescence, each with a fist over his heart.

She'd seen how Chaol could barely look at them---the palace guards and those at the docks.

Sartaq led her through the small door, the bronze of the gate nearly a foot thick, and onto the broad, cobblestoned avenue that sloped into the labyrinth of city streets.
Fine houses and more guards lined the surrounding streets, residences of the wealthy who wished to dwell in the palace's shadow.
But the street itself was crammed with people about their business or leisure, even some travelers who climbed all the way up here to gawk at the palace, and now tried to peer through the small door through which Nesryn and Sartaq had walked for a glimpse to the courtyard beyond.
None seemed to recognize the prince beside her---though she knew the guards on the street and stationed at the gates monitored every breath and word.

One glance at Sartaq, and she had no doubt the prince was also well aware of his surroundings while he stood beyond the gates, as if he were an ordinary man.
She studied the crowded streets ahead, listening to the clamor.
It would take an hour on foot to reach her family's house across the city, but even longer in a carriage or on horseback thanks to the clogged traffic.

"Are you sure you don't need an escort?"

A half smile tugged on Nesryn's mouth as she found him watching her sidelong.
"I can handle myself, Prince, but I thank you for the honor."

Sartaq looked her over, a quick warrior's assessment.
Indeed, he was a man who had little to fear when stepping beyond the palace walls.
"If you ever have the time or interest, you should come for a ride.
The air up there is open---not like the dust and brine down here."

Open enough where listening ears might not hear them.

Nesryn bowed deeply.
"I should like that very much."

She felt the prince still watching while she strode down the sunny avenue, dodging carts and conveyances fighting for passage.
But she didn't dare look back.
She wasn't entirely sure why.
