Yet again, I'm faced with the daunting prospect of conveying my gratitude for the many wonderful people in my life who made this book a reality. But my endless love and thanks go out to:

My husband, Josh: You are my light, my rock, my best friend, my safe harbor ---basically, my \emph{everything}. Thank you for taking such good care of me, for loving me, for joining me on this incredible journey. Your laugh is my favorite sound in the entire world.

To Annie: You sat with me for the months it took to write and edit this book, so part of me feels like your name should be on the cover, too, but until they start giving canine companions writing credits, this will have to suffice. I love you, baby pup. Your curly tail, your bat-like ears, your general sass, and the unfailing pep in your step  All of it. Here's to writing many more books together---and many more cuddles.

To my agent, Tamar: Ten books in, and I'm still unable to convey how grateful I am for all that you do. Thank you, thank you, thank you for being in my corner, for working so damn hard, and for being an all-around badass.
